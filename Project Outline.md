# Project Outline for KesefAv
1. Market Climate Assumptions

Identify Key Market Indicators: Select indicators like RSI, MACD, and sentiment scores.
Define Market Conditions: Create conditions for different market climates (e.g., bull, bear, sideways).
Formalization: Develop mathematical formulas and criteria for each market climate.
2. Formalization and Fitting

Data Collection: Gather historical market data and news sentiment data.
Model Fitting: Fit the predictive models to the collected data, ensuring they align with the defined market climates.
Validation: Use statistical methods to validate the models.
3. Predictive Indicators

Indicator Development: Develop new indicators or refine existing ones to improve predictive accuracy.
Assumption Testing: Test assumptions under various market conditions to ensure robustness.
Confidence Intervals: Establish confidence intervals and prediction horizons for each indicator.
4. Sentiment Analysis Integration

Sentiment Analysis: Use libraries like VaderSentiment to analyze news headlines and social media posts.
Correlation with Market Data: Correlate sentiment scores with market movements to refine predictive models.
Display: Integrate sentiment scores into the tabular output with OHLC data.
5. Experimentation and Refinement Procedures

Experiment Design: Design experiments to test different models and indicators.
Protocol Development: Develop protocols for consistent testing and refinement.
Documentation: Document all experiments and results to maintain a clear development trail.
6. Economic and Mathematical Thinking

Transcript Analysis: Analyze the mangled transcripts for valuable economic and mathematical insights.
Formalization: Formalize these insights into usable models or indicators.
Integration: Integrate these models into the predictive system.
7. Development Environment Setup

CI/CD Pipeline: Set up a continuous integration and deployment pipeline to ensure code quality and automated testing.
Environment Configuration: Ensure all necessary tools and libraries (e.g., Babashka, Pandas, yFinance, VaderSentiment) are installed and configured.
Shell Configuration: Update .zshrc to include necessary plugins and configurations for a smooth workflow.
